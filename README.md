# Machine_learning_projects
In this file it can be found machine learning projects I have worked on during online courses. The programming language employed was Python and the model were trained in Jupyter notebooks and Google colab.

Those courses were:

**1) Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs (Jovian)**

**2) Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs (Jovian)**

**3) Machine Learning with Python (FreeCodeCamp)**

The projects I worked on are briefly described below:

**1) Airline Passengers Satisfaction (Classification problem):**
Using Scikit-learn and logistic regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests to create different models that will predict the Satisfaction of the clients with their airline based on the importance of some features.

**2) Cat-Dog Image classification:**
Building a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict if the image given to the model belongs to a dog or a cat.

**3) Book Recommendation Engine using K-nearest Neighbors:**
Using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) from scikit-learn the model suggests books similar with a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures the distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.

**4) Health cost predictions using Regression algorithms:**
Using a Feedforward NN (better) or Random Forests regression algorithm (less accurate, more effort needed in hyperparameters tuning) to train a model which predicts the health charges within an error less than 3500$  based on features of the customers (age,bmi index,gender,etc).

**5) SMS text classification using NN:**
Using 1D CNN (alternatively a RNN network using LSTM would work) to construct a model which classifies text messsages as spam (if they were related with some advertisement) or ham (messages received from friends,business, etc).

**6) KMNIST CLassification using PyTorch:**
In this project I emplyed the well-known KMNIST library and PyTorch to train a CNN based model which will accurately identifies the images category in KMNIST dataset. The model has been trained in GPU for computationally efficient training and a pipeline for transfering the data between the CPU adn GPU has been build.
