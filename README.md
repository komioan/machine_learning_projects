# Machine_learning_projects
In this file it can be found machine learning projects I have worked on during online courses. The programming language employed was Python and the model were trained in Jupyter notebooks and Goocle colab.
Those courses were:
1) Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs (Jovian)
2) Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs (Jovian)
3) Machine Learning with Python (FreeCodeCamp)
