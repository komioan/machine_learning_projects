# Machine_learning_projects
In this file it can be found machine learning projects I have worked on during online courses. The programming language employed was Python and the model were trained in Jupyter notebooks and Goocle colab.

Those courses were:

**1) Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs (Jovian)**

**2) Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs (Jovian)**

**3) Machine Learning with Python (FreeCodeCamp)**

The projects I worked on are briefly described below:
**1) Airline Passengers Satisfaction (Classification problem):**
Using Scikit-learn and logistic regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests to create different models that will predict the Satisfaction of the clients with their airline based on the importance of some parameters.

**2) Cat-Dog Image classification:**
Building a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict if the image gien to the model belongs to a dog or a cat.
